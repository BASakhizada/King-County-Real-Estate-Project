# King-County-Real-Estate-Project

### Project Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to analyze factors that influence real estate prices and build predictive models that estimate house prices based on various property features. By understanding these factors, the project aims to provide insights that could benefit potential home buyers, real estate professionals, and investors in making informed decisions about property investments. Specifically, the project will focus on identifying key drivers of property prices, exploring patterns and trends in house sales, and using predictive model techniques to predict house prices based on historical data.

### Context:
The real estate market is highly dynamic, influenced by a variety of factors such as property size, location, condition, and local economic conditions. Predicting house prices accurately is valuable not only for real estate agents and homebuyers but also for urban planners, real estate developers, and policy makers. In a competitive market, small changes in property attributes can lead to significant fluctuations in price, making it important to quantify these impacts.
The dataset used for this project comes from Kaggle’s House Sales in King County, USA dataset, which includes house sales from King County (Seattle), Washington. The dataset contains over 21,000 entries with features ranging from basic characteristics like the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to more complex attributes like the presence of a waterfront or recent renovations.

### Key Questions:
1. What factors most significantly impact price of a property?
2. Which variables (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms, year built, etc.) have the highest correlation with property prices?
3. Can we build an accurate predictive model for estimating house prices?
4. Which machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.) perform best in predicting house prices?
5. Are there seasonal effects or trends across the one-year sales data?
6. Do properties with recent renovations have higher price tags?

### Data:
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle and contains house sale prices for King County, including Seattle. It includes houses sold between May 2014 and May 2015. The real estate dataset contains 21,613 records, each representing a property sale in King County, Washington.

### Approach:
Data Exploration and Cleaning: 
•	Handle any missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers. 

•	Explore the distribution of key variables and visualize correlations. 

•	Create new features (if needed) such as age of the property or price per square foot.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
•	Analyze how each feature impacts property prices.

•	Use visualization tools like scatter plots, heatmaps, bar charts, box plots etc. to uncover patterns in the data. 

Predictive Analysis
•	Applying Linear Regression

•	Applying K-Means, cluster analysis model


### Tools Used:
• Python for data cleaning, analysis and running predictive models, and Tableau for reporting and presentation.
